## Introduction

The business is a financial institution that helps people save and invest money. There are three big database that stores the list of users (like a contacts list),
list of their savings accounts, and list of their investment plans. This report identifies customers who have both a savings and an investment plan (cross-selling opportunity).
This project generates a complete financial summary report for users based on their savings and investment records stored across multiple relational database tables.

---

## Objective
The objective is to make a single report that shows for each user:
- Their unique ID and email
- Number of savings accounts
- Number of investment plans
- Total amount of confirmed savings and investments

---

## Dataset Distribution
In modern fintech systems, customer data is often distributed across multiple database tables. The database stores:
- User data in `users_customuser`
- Savings transactions in `savings_savingsaccount`
- Investment plans in `plans_plan`
---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Start with the users table,`users_customuser`**  
Step 1: Start with a list of all users 'adashi_staging.users_customuser'
I begin with the user table. This gives me: A unique ID (called owner_id).Their email (since there is no name column in the three tables)

```
SELECT 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id AS owner_id;
```

```
adashi_staging.users_customuser.email AS name;
```

2. **Build a savings summary subquery**
Step 2: Select the savings table 'adashi_staging.savings_savingsaccount'
I counted how many savings accounts each person has and how much they‚Äôve saved in total
I summarize that info using a small temporary report just for savings.

```
SELECT 
    owner_id,
    COUNT(*) AS savings_count,
    SUM(confirmed_amount) AS total_savings
FROM adashi_staging.savings_savingsaccount
GROUP BY owner_id
```

3. **Build an investment summary subquery**  
Step 3: Select the investment table 'plans_plan'
I counted how many fixed investment plans they have and how much total money they‚Äôve invested
Again, I build a small summary for this.

```
SELECT 
    owner_id,
    COUNT(*) AS investment_count,
    SUM(amount) AS total_investment
FROM plans_plan
WHERE is_fixed_investment = 1
GROUP BY owner_id;
```
4. **Handling Missing Data with COALESCE**
Step 4:  I add up total confirmed savings the user has plus the total investment amount.
But again, either of those might be missing (NULL), especially if the user only saved or only invested.
So I used `COALESCE(..., 0)`

```
COALESCE(savings_summary.savings_count, 0) AS savings_count,
COALESCE(investment_summary.investment_count, 0) AS investment_count,
COALESCE(savings_summary.total_savings, 0) + COALESCE(investment_summary.total_investment, 0) AS total_deposits
```

5. **Join all pieces together**
I join the users_customuser's savings summary with savings_savingsaccount.
This creates one complete row per user with all the information I need.
I Left-joined the savings and investment summaries to the users_customuser.

```
FROM 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser

LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        owner_id,
        COUNT(*) AS savings_count,
        SUM(confirmed_amount) AS total_savings
    FROM adashi_staging.savings_savingsaccount
    GROUP BY owner_id
) AS savings_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = savings_summary.owner_id
```

Also, I left-join the staging.plans_plan's investment summary and savings_savingsaccount.
This creates one complete row per user with all the information I need.

```
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        owner_id,
        COUNT(*) AS investment_count,
        SUM(amount) AS total_investment
    FROM adashi_staging.plans_plan
    WHERE is_fixed_investment = 1
    GROUP BY owner_id
) AS investment_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = investment_summary.owner_id;
```
---

## Challenges I Faced ‚Äî And How I Solved Them:
1. Unclear Column Names
Problem: At first, I assumed the user table had columns like id, name, first_name.
Fix: I asked you to share the actual column names. Once we saw that the user table used owner_id and email, I adjusted the query accordingly.

2. Missing Data (Null values)
Problem: Some users might not have any savings or investments, which would return "nothing" instead of 0.

Fix: I used a function called COALESCE() in SQL, which means: ‚Äúif this value is missing, just show 0 instead.‚Äù

3. Joining Different Tables
Problem: It‚Äôs tricky to combine savings and investment data because each user could have multiple records.

Fix: I created summary tables that:

Counted savings and summed deposits per user

Counted investments and summed amounts per user
Then I joined these summaries back to the main user list.

## Single SQL Query
```
SELECT 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id AS owner_id,
    adashi_staging.users_customuser.email AS name,
    COALESCE(savings_summary.savings_count, 0) AS savings_count,
    COALESCE(investment_summary.investment_count, 0) AS investment_count,
    COALESCE(savings_summary.total_savings, 0) + COALESCE(investment_summary.total_investment, 0) AS total_deposits
FROM 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser

LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        owner_id,
        COUNT(*) AS savings_count,
        SUM(confirmed_amount) AS total_savings
    FROM adashi_staging.savings_savingsaccount
    GROUP BY owner_id
) AS savings_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = savings_summary.owner_id

LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT 
        owner_id,
        COUNT(*) AS investment_count,
        SUM(amount) AS total_investment
    FROM adashi_staging.plans_plan
    WHERE is_fixed_investment = 1
    GROUP BY owner_id
) AS investment_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = investment_summary.owner_id;
```
## Detailed Line By Line Explanation of Query

```
SELECT 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id AS owner_id,  -- The correct column to use for identifying users for the three tables is owner_id. I selected owner_id from the users_customuser 
                                                              table as a unique identifier for each user.
    adashi_staging.users_customuser.email AS name,   -- There is no first_name or last_name column across the three tables except the customuser. Since there's no name column, I'm using 
                                                        the user‚Äôs email as a way to identify them. I labelled this column as 'name'. Email is used in place of name to represent the user.
    COALESCE(savings_summary.savings_count, 0) AS savings_count,  -- Number of savings entries (0 if none). Ensures that users with no savings or investments show 0 instead of NULL
    COALESCE(investment_summary.investment_count, 0) AS investment_count,  -- Number of investment plans (If this user has no savings, show 0 instead of NULL). Counts and sums savings and 
                                                                              investment data per user.
    COALESCE(savings_summary.total_savings, 0) + COALESCE(investment_summary.total_investment, 0) AS total_deposits  -- This calculates the total money the user has deposited:
                                                                    It adds total_savings and total_investment. If either one is missing (NULL), COALESCE replaces it with 0 so the math works.
FROM 
    adashi_staging.users_customuser  -- Main user table


LEFT JOIN (        -- I am now joining savings data to each user even if they have no savings.
    SELECT 
        owner_id,  -- Grouped user reference from the savings table
        COUNT(*) AS savings_count,  -- Counts how many savings records each user has.
        SUM(confirmed_amount) AS total_savings  -- Total confirmed savings amount. Adds up all the confirmed savings
    FROM adashi_staging.savings_savingsaccount
    GROUP BY owner_id  --  GROUP BY owner_id groups the results so we get one row per user.
) AS savings_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = savings_summary.owner_id  --  I name the summary savings_summary, and match it to users by comparing their owner_id.


LEFT JOIN (  --- I join investment data to users ‚Äî again using LEFT JOIN so users without investments still appear.

```
SELECT 
        owner_id,  -- Grouped user reference from the investment table. I name the investment summary table and match it to each user by owner_id.

        SUM(amount) AS total_investment  -- Total investment amount
    FROM adashi_staging.plans_plan
    WHERE is_fixed_investment = 1  -- Filter only fixed investment plans
    GROUP BY owner_id  -- Aggregate by user
) AS investment_summary
ON adashi_staging.users_customuser.owner_id = investment_summary.owner_id;  -- Join condition: match user ID with investment records
